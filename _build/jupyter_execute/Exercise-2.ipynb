    "# Exercise 2: Slicing and Selecting in DataFrames in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises cover various aspects of slicing and selecting data in pandas DataFrames, including basic filtering, conditional selection, and more complex queries. They are designed to enhance your skills in using `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`, boolean indexing, and `.query()` methods effectively for data manipulation tasks."
