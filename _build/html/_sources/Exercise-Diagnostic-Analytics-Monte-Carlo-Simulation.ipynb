    "\n",
    "Customers arrive at a photocopying machine at an average rate of 2 every five minutes. Assume that these arrivals are independent, with a constant arrival rate, and that this problem follows a Poisson model, with \\( X \\) denoting the number of arriving customers in a 5-minute period and mean \\( \\lambda = 2 \\).\n",
